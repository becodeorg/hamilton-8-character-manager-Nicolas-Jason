## Overview

### The challenge


Create a site with JS where we had to create characters, edit characters, delete characters and display them only once click on them while using an API and JS.

We had to:

- Be as semantic as possible
- Use the seven-to-one method
- SASS or other
- JavaScript
- Git
- Use API requests
- use a bundler
